I have to admit to being a little disappointed in the Visions of Fire book from Gillian Anderson. I had been looking forward to reading this for some time, and I found it to be somewhat flighty. A really interesting premise, however, and I will likely give the next book a shot to see where the story goes.

Solo was fantastic, and I am really glad that I got the novelization of the movie. I enjoyed the movie too, and perhaps that puts me outside the mainstream on things. I'm a huge fan of the all the recent Star Wars films, and that's not saying I have any lack of loyalty to the originals. This novelization, however, did a great job of fleshing out a wee bit more detail for the characters and was well worth the read.

Feast of Crows, by the way, took me about two years to read, I swear. I hardly even remember starting it. Sigh. I plan on digging into whatever else I can find from GRRM, though, because it was just so good.
