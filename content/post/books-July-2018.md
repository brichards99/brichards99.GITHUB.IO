This month I took advantage of Humble Bundle's DC Comics offering, which included a bunch of audiobooks from Graphic Audio. Both the Wonder Womand and the Wayne of Gotham books were gripping, exciting, fun -- all that. Final Crisis, on the other hand, was a book I probably would have enjoyed more if I had a better background in DC storylines. And perhaps if I had read some of the previous series, such as 52. Also may have been better to have simply read it on paper.

Two absolutely terrific books this month were Any Man by AMber Tamblyn and The Cabin at the End of the World by Paul Tremblay. Any Man is a unique read, with a narrative style that I would hate to say sounds just like what a poet would do, but it sounds just like what a poet such as Amber Tamblyn would do. Timely as well, to read a novel of men being victimized using character experiences often associated with female victimes of male predators. Timely in that it was a good poke in the male perspective for me, a male reader, at a time when male peoples all around really need to be thinking outside their own testerone soaked ideas.

Now The Cabin at the End of the World was just fun. Straightforward narrative and a story that evolved in a way that really makes you question what is happening. Or what the charactes think is happening. It's good. Go read it.
