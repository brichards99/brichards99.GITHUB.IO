Lots of fun stuff this month. It goes without saying that Wanderers by Chuck Wendig was a long, enjoyable ride worth recommending to everyone. The book has been popular since its really, and rightly so. It's a bit of a hopeful apocalyptic story, but maybe I have a screwed up perspective on the end of the world. It's also a wee bit poiitical, and does a good job of shining an indirect light on how damaging our current president's bullshit politics can be.

Earthworm Gods was also a blast to read. This is fun, creepy horror with kind of a unique twist on the creature feature concept. Brian Keene is a certain kind of horror writer that I know is not everyone's cup of tea, but I like his style a lot. Can't wait to dig into the next one, so to speak.
