The following were books I finished reading during the month of July.

* [Stranger Things Darkness on the Edge of Town - Adam Christopher](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K5ZZ3X3/ref=dbs_a_def_awm_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0)
* [Quiet - Susan Cain](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking-ebook/dp/B004J4WNL2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
* [I'll Be Gone in the Dark - Michelle McNamara](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HF88TL7/ref=dbs_a_def_awm_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0)

I really got swept up in "I'll Be Gone in the Dark." I have not read a whole lot of true crime stuff before, and something that I really appreciated about this was learning so much of McNamara's personal ups and downs with her investigations. The impact of her own life experiences on how she chose to become an amateur detective of sorts was fascinating, and it built a third layer of empathy for me on top of the impact I learned of these crimes on the victims and the law enforcement personnel investigating this brutal criminal.

"Quiet" is a book I had been meaning to read for some time, as I have struggled (probably a strong word for it) with my own place as an introvert in work environments that seem to clearly favor the extroverted. Here I learned a lot about the research that has been done into how introversion / extroversion works, but more importantly this book just kind of reinforced my own feelings about how introverts are treated.

Like crap. We're treated like crap.
