I finished these books during the month of May, 2019.

* [Anansi Boys - Neil Gaiman](https://www.audible.com/pd/Anansi-Boys-Audiobook/B002V8LI0U?pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=3ESSG0DSS1TZA34RB8QJ&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B002V8LI0U)
* [Killer Crabs - Guy N. Smith](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A90FNE/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
* [The Meg - Steve Alten](https://www.audible.com/pd/Meg-A-Novel-of-Deep-Terror-with-Meg-Origins-Audiobook/B00JAN9K4U?pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=0BZ3BJCPVSJY1FPMMJY7&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B00JAN9K4U)
* [The Consuming Fire - John Scalzi](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Consuming-Fire-Audiobook/B07HNMVMK8?pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=0BZ3BJCPVSJY1FPMMJY7&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B07HNMVMK8)
* [The Necroscope - Brian Lumley](https://www.audible.com/pd/Necroscope-Audiobook/B0191VQDH2?pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=0BZ3BJCPVSJY1FPMMJY7&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B0191VQDH2)
* [Alien III - William Gibson](https://www.audible.com/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QY3KR81?pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=0BZ3BJCPVSJY1FPMMJY7&ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_B07QY3KR81)

These books were fantastic. All of them. The reading I did this month reminded me of summers hunkered in my bedroom, sweating from the heat (because we had no air conditioning upstairs in our house) flipping through the grainy pages of books I had scooped up at Waldenbooks in between drooling over the manuals in the Dungeons and Dragons section and walking past the arcade wishing I had the quarters to play.

Killer Crabs is, admittedly, not exactly the kind of book I would recommend to everyone, but this is the second of Guy N. Smith's crab books I've read and enjoyed every page of. It's just good, campy fun.

The Meg introduced me to Steve Alten, from whom I know I'll be looking for more. And Necroscope is a book I've been meaning to get to for years, ever since another writer recommended it to me at a workshop I attended with Borderlands Press. That book was good, sticky fun.

It's interesting to me now that I look at this list and realize that most of what I read this month was in the form of an audiobook. Really good ones, too. The narrators for both Necroscope and Anansi Boys were really enjoyable and I would gladly listen to more of each.

I was also happy to see that I will be able to find more books by Brian Lumley and Steven Alten among the digital offerings at the library. I try as best I can to take advantage of both audio and ebook versions that I can get through the library, although right now I have such a huge backlog of Kindle and Audible stuff that I feel obligated to keep it up within my own stack, so to speak.
