I got 2019 off to a good start by reading the following this month:

* [City of Ghosts - V.E. Schwab](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1338111000/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i5)
* ['Salem's Lot - Stephen King](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LV31E/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
* [Zen: Beginner's Guide - Ian Tuhovsky](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PWUBSEK/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)

Seems like kind of a paltry list, but these were good, solid reads. 

I make no excuses about City of Ghosts -- it is a young adult book. Fine. Sue me. I have heard so many good things about Schwab's writing, and I think this story gave me solid proof that the rumors were true. Great story and interesting characters, and a premise that I happen to find really interesting. Glad I read it.

'Salem's Lot is one of the first King books I read way back in the days when my mom would take me to the flea market outside of the Hills in Lewisburg. Some library very often had a stall there that sold hard cover library copies, and this is where I first found Stephen King. Differen Seasons, Christine, Carrie, 'Salem's Lot, and the Shining all came to me in big hardcover editions wrapped in that durable plastic libraries use. There was much about the story I had forgotten, and it was a pleasure to revisit the book. I'll keep this in mind when I consider rereading other King books (I've already started my way back through the Dark Tower series again.)
