An important part of every IT professional’s job is continuing education. For the most part we see this as attending conferences and signing up for classes related to new technologies, but one of the simplest (and cheapest) things is to simply stay informed. For anyone in this field, but infosec professionals in particular, Bruce Schneier’s Crypto-gram newsletter is an invaluable source of information about current events.

In addition to news about the latest breaches and malware attacks, Schneier typically includes links to either his own essays or to online articles addressing topics such as privacy, public policy, and the relationship between media and the IT field.

You can subscribe to his newsletter on his website:

About once a term I drop a note about this resource. The most recent edition (from January 15) includes a valuable discussion of the implications of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Check it out!
